          <h2>Ten Tips to Save you Time and Frustration When Programming</h2>
          <p>
            I started and quit programming at least four times before I stuck
            with it. My survey of my data science students shows me this story
            is far from unusual. Many false starts are due in part to the slow
            and tedious process of learning to code and the frustration that
            accompanies it. Consequently, I‚Äôm passionate about removing the
            unnecessary obstacles that prevent people from becoming competent
            coders. There will always be obstacles, but there‚Äôs no reason for
            unnecessary obstacles. üòÅ Here are 10 tips to help you more quickly
            leap over the hurdles and achieve a sense of competency. Many of
            these tips might seem minor or obvious to you if you‚Äôve been coding
            for years, but when starting out, nothing is obvious. And even if
            you‚Äôve been coding since cell phones were called car phones, there
            might be a tip or two that will save you time. üéâ

<h3>How to Be Happy: 4 Ways to Be Happier</h3>


<div class="content-text">
<h5>1. Find out what to do first.</h5>
<p>How are you supposed to build the right happiness skills if you don't know which ones you are struggling with in the first place? This is why it's helpful to take a quiz to explore your happiness strengths and weaknesses. Get a better understanding of what these skills are all about, and learn how to improve upon your weaknesses and build your "happiness strengths." </p>
</div>
<div class="content-text">
<h5>2. Give yourself a confidence boost.</h5>
<p>Why would you bother increasing your happiness if you didn't think you could be successful at it? You wouldn't. That's why it's so important to build your self-efficacy ‚Äî to prove to yourself that you can increase your happiness. The best way to do this is by starting with easier skills ‚Äî skills like gratitude or prioritizing spending time doing fun things. Get a quick win, and you'll be more confident that you really can change your life. </p>
</div>
<div class="content-text">
<h5>3. Fuel your progress by learning how to feel better about yourself.</h5>
<p>You wouldn't practice math to get better at cooking. And you wouldn't learn another language to lose weight. To be happier, you'll likely make more progress by focusing on the skills that are most closely linked to happiness. In my research, the skill that usually turns out to be most closely linked to happiness is: positive self-views. Learning how to feel better about yourself ‚Äî for example, by imagining your best possible self, noting your positive qualities, or identifying your strengths ‚Äî can go a long way to increasing your happiness. </p>
</div>
<div class="content-text">
<h5>4. Create balance and overcome burnout.</h5>
<p>How are you supposed to have the energy to be happier if you're stressed, exhausted ,and miserable from work? It will be really hard. Building new skills, skills that will help you be happier, will take time and energy. So it's helpful first to create better work-life balance. </p>
